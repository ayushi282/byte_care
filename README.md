I made this website using the figma link - https://www.figma.com/file/Xn8vAqkN0NpG94oqJmH3hA/Frontend-Test-Design?node-id=1%3A339&mode=dev
to get the content you ahve click on the home event from the nav bar and for now rest of them are empty js files so they might five errors file clicking on them and the normal page will also be empty for now but content for now is available on home page.
process- 
click on home even to see the content
